LiveHike is a native iOS application designed to address the lack of real-time safety information available to hikers in the Berkeley and Bay Area. 
While existing hiking apps provide general trail information, LiveHike focuses on creating a community-driven platform where hikers can report and access up-to-the-minute 
hazard updates, wildlife sightings, and navigation assistance.
